# GoalsApp 

A personal project of mine, to develop an app to track personal goals. 

## About 

I chose to develop this app using swift 3, since it was the latest available version. 

### TODO

- Add [charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts). A useful tutorial may be found [here](https://medium.com/@skoli/using-realm-and-charts-with-swift-3-in-ios-10-40c42e3838c0)

- decide on whether a table view or vertical stack view is more appropriate for your design
